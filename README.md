## Electric Vehicle Price & Performance Analysis (EDA)
## Project Overview

This project explores the Electric Vehicle (EV) market dataset to analyze how different factors such as battery capacity, efficiency, top speed, acceleration, and price vary across EV models.

The goal is to identify key trends, patterns, and correlations in EV pricing and performance that influence consumer choice and market segmentation.

## Business Objectives
Understand Market Segmentation
Identify how EVs differ in price categories (budget, mid-range, premium).
Battery Capacity vs. Range
Analyze how battery size influences driving range.
Performance Analysis
Compare top speed and acceleration across EVs.
Energy Efficiency
Study which vehicle types are most efficient (Wh/km).
Price Drivers
Identify the strongest correlations between price and other EV attributes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Drive Type Distribution

Most EVs are AWD (All-Wheel Drive) or RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive).

FWD (Front-Wheel Drive) appears mainly in budget EVs.

2. Number of Seats

Majority of EVs are 5-seaters, targeting families.

Smaller shares of 2-seaters (sports cars) and 7-seaters (SUVs/MPVs).

3. Battery Capacity

Most EVs fall in the 50â€“100 kWh range.

Premium EVs exceed 100 kWh.

4. Range Distribution

Common range: 250â€“500 km.

Rare luxury EVs exceed 600 km.

5. Efficiency

Typical values: 150â€“220 Wh/km.

Compact EVs are most efficient; sports EVs consume more.

6. Top Speed

Mainstream EVs: 150â€“250 km/h.

Sports EVs: 250+ km/h (e.g., Porsche Taycan, Tesla Plaid).

7. Acceleration (0â€“100 km/h)

Most EVs: 6â€“10 sec.

High-performance EVs: 2â€“3 sec.

8. Price Segmentation

Budget EVs: â‚¬30kâ€“40k.

Mid-tier: â‚¬50kâ€“80k.

Premium: â‚¬100k+.

9. Correlation Heatmap

Strong correlation:

Battery_kWh â†” Range

Price â†” Battery/Range/TopSpeed

Weak correlation:

Seats â†” Performance

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

Range & Performance drive EV pricing â€” higher battery, longer range, faster cars = more expensive.

5-seaters dominate the EV market, showing focus on family cars.

Efficiency varies by class â€” smaller cars win on efficiency, luxury EVs win on power.

Clear segmentation exists: budget, mid-range, and luxury EVs.
